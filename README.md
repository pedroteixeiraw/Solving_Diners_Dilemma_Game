# Solving_Diners_Dilemma_Gamme

We solved the Diner's Dilemma Game with four players by leveraging quantum mechanics. The dilemma of the game is overcome with a quantum strategy that lies between the Pareto Optimal point and the Nash Equilibrium Point. The quantum strategy in question maximizes individual scores without affecting the scores and strategies of the other players, taking advantage of the phenomena of superposition and entanglement that allow a quantum supremacy over classical strategies. A quantum circuit was created that translates the environment of the 'diner's dilemma game' using Qiskit tools. Several simulations of possible quantum strategies were performed in a simulator to test the different premises presented.
